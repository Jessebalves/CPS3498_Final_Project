## What I Learned
<!-- Highlight specific skills or concepts you learned or improved upon while working on this project. This section should directly address potential employer interests. -->
- **Flask**: Connected our frontend to our backend using a web framework and Python.
- **Database Connectivity**: Setting up and connecting a database that allows for data retrieval from the frontend.
- **Server Deployment and Configuration**: Setting up a Linux cloud server using Digital Ocean to serve web contents to clients.
- **Assigning a Domain Name**: Using CloudFlare to claim and assign a domain name to a specified Internet Protocol Address.

## Setup and Installation
<!--*Provide a clear, step-by-step guide to set up the project locally.*-->
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Jessebalves/TrashScheduleNJ.git`
2. Install Visual Studio Code.
3. Once installed, navigate to extensions. Download the extension named Live Server to view live changes made to the code base.
4. Right click on the file you want to open with Live Server, then select the Live Server option to view live changes. 

## Usage
*This project has limited usage due to restricted API keys and security behind our own database. Users can connect their own database through the python file running flask.*

## Code Examples
<!-- *Show small, but significant snippets of code from your project.* -->

## How to Contribute
<!--*Encourage contributions and provide guidelines for how others can help.*-->
Our system uses Flask on the backend, feel free to connect your own database through the python file as we do not offer public access to the database for this project. If you would like to connect your own database, keep in mind that the ward look up and the process which data is passed from the backend to the frontend will have to be reworked. The main table will have to be reworked if you would like to add a new pick up type, such as grass and leaves.
